### This project explains the core concepts related to using State in Jetpack Compose. It shows you how the app's state determines what is displayed in the UI, how Compose updates the UI when state changes by working with different APIs, how to optimize the structure of our composable functions, and using ViewModels in a Compose world.

### What i learn
- How to think about state and events in a Jetpack Compose UI.
- How Compose uses state to determine which elements to display on the screen.
- What state hoisting is.
- How stateful and stateless composable functions work.
- How Compose automatically tracks state with the State<T> API.
- How memory and internal state work in a composable function: using the remember and rememberSaveable APIs.
- How to work with lists and state: using the mutableStateListOf and toMutableStateList APIs.
- How to use ViewModel with Compose.
